As a business school student, you will learn to take academic theories and apply them to real-world problems. Business schools craft students into astute decision makers and professionals who can readily navigate uncertainty, risk, and change. 

Business school overview
The b-school curriculum is challenging, and students must work hard to keep up. But the bottom line is that the goal of every business student is to get a challenging, high-paying job after graduation. So for most, earning perfect grades is not as important as making contacts with peers, professors, and executives who will be helpful down the road.
